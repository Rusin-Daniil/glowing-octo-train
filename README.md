In the classical Julius Caesar algorithm, each character of the original secret message is replaced by a character from the same alphabet, three positions further away. For example, for the Russian alphabet, the letter A will be replaced by the letter G, B by D, etc. This algorithm refers to replacement algorithms. The "." character at the end of the line indicates that the encryption has been completed.
For example, if the source text was like this: 
Zb Ra Cx Dyk., then the result of the encryption should be as follows: 
Ce Ud Fa Gbn.
Implement the Julius Caesar algorithm in Python for the letters of the Russian and English alphabets.
